 Visit [this site](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flashcards-starter).

 On the top right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button.

#### Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
